Clang is an all-in-one self hosted discord bot witten with pycord, inspired by Valkyrja. Handles moderation, tickets, logging, notes, and fun commands.

Clang is fully modular, extendable, extensible, and customizable with its functionality to dynamically load plugins.

Clang is a skull kept alive by eldritch magic. It screams and talks nonsense.

Please view the [installation guide](https://github.com/maidnaut/clang/wiki/Installation-Guide) for instructions on how to get it up and running.
